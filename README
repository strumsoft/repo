$ mvn -DaltDeploymentRepository=snapshot-repo::default::file://<abs-path> clean deploy

snapshot-repo::default::file:.<path>

It’s a three-part descriptor of sorts:

1. snapshot-repo is the ID of the repository we’re defining, and can refer to one of the repositories specified in the <distributionManagement> section of the pom.xml.  This allows one to change a repository’s URL while retaining other <distributionManagement> configuration that might be set.

2. default is the repository type; unless you’re monkeying with Maven 1-style repositories (hardly anyone is these days), this is required.

3. file:<path> is the actual repository URL, and has to be relative to the root of your project, or absolute. No ~ here, etc.
